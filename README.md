# AI683 Midterm Project: Predicting Diabetes

## Project Overview
This project is part of the AI683 Statistical Learning course midterm assignment. The goal is to develop a statistical model to predict diabetes based on real data, illustrating inferential statistics concepts such as prediction, uncertainty quantification, and hypothesis testing.

The deliverables include:
- A Jupyter Notebook integrating presentation material (slides and code)
- A memo summarizing the problem, methods, key results, risks, and recommendations

## Repository Contents
- `AI683_Midterm_YourLastname.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook with embedded slides and code examples.
- `Presentation-Predicting-Diabetes.pdf`: PDF of the presentation slides.
- `AI683_Midterm_Memo_YourLastname.pdf`: One-page memo report (upload separately as required).

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `AI683_Midterm_YourLastname.ipynb`
2. Ensure the PDF `Presentation-Predicting-Diabetes.pdf` is in the same folder to view embedded slides.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to explore the data analysis, statistical methods, and results.
